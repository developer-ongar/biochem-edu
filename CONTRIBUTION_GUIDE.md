1.	Have a GitHub account with SSH keys set up.
2.	Fork the repository on GitHub.
3.	Clone your fork of the repository locally (i.e., git clone git@github.com:yourusername/molecular-mirror-app).
4.	Create a branch to work in (i.e., git checkout -b mybranch).
5.	Make changes to your fork of the repository, commit them, and push them (i.e., git add -A . && git commit -m 'My Changes (fixes #1234)' && git push origin mybranch).
6.	Submit a pull request against the master branch. If you head to the MoleculARweb repository after running git push from earlier, you should see a pop up to submit a pull request.
7.	Address review comments if any.

If you want to contribute with translations follow these steps:

1.	Look for the language prefix. For example, ‚Äúen‚Äù, ‚Äúes‚Äù, ‚Äúfr‚Äù etc.
2.	Create a folder inside the locales directory using that prefix as name.
3.	Copy and paste translations.json from ‚Äúen‚Äù folder so you can use it as template.
4.	Replace all values inside that file. Do not change the key, otherwise it will not work, just edit the text like this: ‚ÄúdoNotEdit‚Äù: ‚ÄúEdit me in your language üòä‚Äù.
5.	Once you are done, follow the previous guide to submit a PR.
